# UC Parking Availability
This is an Android app that visualises how many spots are available at the University of Canberra using live data.

Haven't worked on this in a while, this is mainly just me practising Android development. It's still a work in progress so don't expect great code practices, many tests, or documentation. I'll get around to those someday (like all my other projects, ha).
